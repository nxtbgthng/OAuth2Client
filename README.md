# OAuth2Client

An OAuth2 library for Mac OS X & iOS (Cocoa & Cocoa touch).

## Description

This library is based on [draft 10 of the OAuth2 spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-10).
It implements the [native application profile](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-10#section-1.4.3)
and supports the end-user authorization endpoint via an internal or an external user-agent. Furthermore it
also supports the user credentials flow by prompting the end-user for their username and password and use them
directly to obtain an access token. See the description of the delegate for more information how to choose the
authentication flow.

## Getting started

### Get the sources

Getting the sources is as easy as doing a:  
`git clone git://github.com/nxtbgthng/OAuth2Client.git`

### Adding the library to your project using CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Xcode projects. It manages the above
installation steps automatically.

In order to install the library this way add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```pod 'NXOAuth2Client', '~> 1.2.8'```

and run the following command `pod install`.

*Note:* CocoaPods is now the preferred way to integrate NXOAuth2Client into XCode

### Manually including the library in your Xcode project

#### iOS projects

* Place the _OAuth2Client_ folder within your source root
* Drag the _OAuth2Client.xcodeproj_ into your project
* Under your build target, select the _Build Phases_ tab.
    * Under _Target Dependencies_ add _OAuth2Client_
    * Under _Link Binary With Libraries_, add _libOAuth2Client.a_
* Under _Build Settings_,
    * Add `$(SRCROOT)/path/to/OAuth2Client` _Header Search Paths_, set as _recursive_
    * Add `-ObjC` to _Other Linker Flags_
* `#import "NXOAuth2.h"`
* add the Security.framework as a build dependency

#### Desktop Mac projects

- drag the OAuth2Client.xcodeproj into your project
- add OAuth2Client.framework as a build dependency
- add the Security.framework as a build dependency
- add `$(CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR)/$(CONTENTS_FOLDER_PATH)/Frameworks` to your targets Framework Search Path
- link your target against OAuth2Client (drag the OAuth2Client.framework product from OAuth2Client.xcodeproj
to your targets *Link Binary With Libraries*)
- `#import <OAuth2Client/NXOAuth2.h>`

*Using the library as a framework in desktop applications is fairly untested. Please
[report any issues](http://github.com/nxtbgthng/OAuth2Client/issues) and help in making the library better.*



## Using the OAuth2Client

### Configure your Client

The best place to configure your client is `+[UIApplicationDelegate initialize]` on iOS or `+[NSApplicationDelegate initialize]` on Mac OS X. There you can call `-[NXOAuth2AccountStore setClientID:secret:authorizationURL:tokenURL:redirectURL:forAccountType:]` on the shared account store for each service you want to have access to from your application. The account type is a string which is used as an identifier for a certain service.

<pre>
+ (void)initialize;
{
	[[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] setClientID:@"xXxXxXxXxXxX"
                                             secret:@"xXxXxXxXxXxX"
                                   authorizationURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://...your auth URL..."]
                                           tokenURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://...your token URL..."]
                                        redirectURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://...your redirect URL..."]
                                     forAccountType:@"myFancyService"];
}
</pre>

Take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/nxtbgthng/OAuth2Client/wiki) for some examples.

Unless otherwise specficied, the token request will be called with a HTTP Header 'Content-Type' set to 'multipart/form-data'.  If you wish that header to be set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', the custom header fields must be modified.

<pre>
NSMutableDictionary *configuration = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:[[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] configurationForAccountType:kOAuth2AccountType]];
NSDictionary *customHeaderFields = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" forKey:@"Content-Type"];
[configuration setObject:customHeaderFields forKey:kNXOAuth2AccountStoreConfigurationCustomHeaderFields];
[[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] setConfiguration:configuration forAccountType:kOAuth2AccountType];
</pre>
  
Consult the documentation of the OAuth2 provider to determine acceptable Content-Type header values. 

    

### Requesting Access to a Service

Once you have configured your client you are ready to request access to one of those services. The NXOAuth2AccountStore provides three different methods for this:

- Username and Password
 <pre>
 [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] requestAccessToAccountWithType:@"myFancyService"
 	                                                       username:aUserName
 	                                                       password:aPassword];
 </pre>

- External Browser
 <pre>
 [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] requestAccessToAccountWithType:@"myFancyService"];
 </pre>
  
 If you are using an external browser, your application needs to handle the URL you have registered as an redirect URL for the account type (e.g. a custom URL scheme like `myfancyscheme://oauth`). The service will redirect to that URL after the authentication process.
 
 In `-[AppDelegate application: openURL: sourceApplication: annotation:]` pass the redirect URL to
 <pre>
     [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] handleRedirectURL: url];
 </pre>

- Provide an Authorization URL Handler
 <pre>
 [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] requestAccessToAccountWithType:@"myFancyService"
 	                            withPreparedAuthorizationURLHandler:^(NSURL *preparedURL){
 	                                // Open a web view or similar
 	                            }];
 </pre>
 Using an authorization URL handler gives you the ability to open the URL in an own web view or do some fancy stuff for authentication. Therefore you pass a block to the NXOAuth2AccountStore while requesting access.
 
 One method for receiving a code and exchanging it for an auth token requires the following:
 
  1) Load the preparedURL into an existing UIWebView as part of the block code above. Be certain to set the delegate for the UIWebView.
  
 <pre>
 [_webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:preparedURL]];
 </pre>
 
  2) In the `webViewDidFinishLoad:` delegate method, you will need to parse the URL for your callback URL.  If there is a match, pass that URL to `-[NXOAuth2AccountStore handleRedirectURL:]`

 <pre>
 if ([webView.request.URL.absoluteString rangeOfString:kOAuth2RedirectURL options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch].location != NSNotFound) {
        [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] handleRedirectURL:[NSURL URLWithString:webView.request.URL.absoluteString]];        
    }
</pre>   

This is a very basic example.  In the above, it is assumed that the `code` being returned from the OAuth2 provider is in the query parameter of the webView.request.URL (i.e. `http://myredirecturl.com?code=<verylongcodestring>`).  This is not always the case and you may have to look elsewhere for the code (e.g. in the page content, web page title).  You must prepare a URL in the format described above to pass to `-[NXOAuth2AccountStore handleRedirectURL:]`.

#### On Success

After a successful authentication, a new `NXOAuth2Account` object is in the list of accounts of `NXOAuth2AccountStore`. You will receive a notification of type `NXOAuth2AccountStoreAccountsDidChangeNotification`, e.g., for updating your UI.
<pre>
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:NXOAuth2AccountStoreAccountsDidChangeNotification
                                                  object:[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore]
                                                   queue:nil
                                              usingBlock:^(NSNotification *aNotification){
                                                    // Update your UI
                                              }];
</pre>
If an account was added the `userInfo` dictionary of the notification will contain the new account at the `NXOAuth2AccountStoreNewAccountUserInfoKey`. Note though that this notification can be triggered on other events (e.g. account removal). In that case this key will not be set.

#### On Failure

If the authentication did not succeed, a notification of type `NXOAuth2AccountStoreDidFailToRequestAccessNotification` containing an `NSError` will be sent.
<pre>
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:NXOAuth2AccountStoreDidFailToRequestAccessNotification
                                                  object:[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore]
                                                   queue:nil
                                              usingBlock:^(NSNotification *aNotification){
                                                    NSError *error = [aNotification.userInfo objectForKey:NXOAuth2AccountStoreErrorKey];
                                                    // Do something with the error
                                              }];
</pre>

### Getting a List of all Accounts

The authenticated accounts can be accessed via the `NXOAuth2AccountStore`. Either the complete list, only a list of accounts for a specific service or an account with an identifier (maybe cached in the user settings).

<pre>
for (NXOAuth2Account *account in [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] accounts]) {
    // Do something with the account
};

for (NXOAuth2Account *account in [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] accountsWithAccountType:@"myFancyService"]) {
    // Do something with the account
};

NXOAuth2Account *account = [[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore] accountWithIdentifier:@"...cached account id..."];
</pre>

Each `NXOAuth2Account` has a property `userData` which can be used to store some related information for that account.
<pre>
NXOAuth2Account *account = // ... get an account
NSDictionary *userData = // ...

account.userData = userData;
</pre>

This payload will be stored together with the accounts in the Keychain. Thus it shouldn't be too big.

### Removing Accounts

To remove an account and its tokens from the store:

<pre>
[[NXOAuth2AccountStore sharedStore]  removeAccount:account];
</pre>

Note that if you used a UIWebView to request access to a service as described above, it's likely that the token has been cached in `[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage]`

You can remove the auth token from the cookie cache using:

<pre>
for(NSHTTPCookie *cookie in [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookies]) {
    if([[cookie domain] isEqualToString:@"myapp.com"]) {
        [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] deleteCookie:cookie];
    }
}
[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize];
</pre>

Where `myapp.com` is the domain from which you received the auth token -- likley the `authorizationURL` assigned to the store at the time of request.  As a convenience, you may want to store the domain of the token in the `account.userData` so that it is readily available if you need to delete the cookies.

### Invoking a Request

A request using the authentication for a service can be invoked via `NXOAuth2Request`. The most convenient method (see below) is a class method which you pass the method, a resource and some parameters (or nil) for the request and to handlers (both optional). One for a progress and the other for the response. The account is used for authentication and can be nil. Then a normal request without authentication will be invoked.
<pre>
[NXOAuth2Request performMethod:@"GET"
                    onResource:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://...your service URL..."]
               usingParameters:nil
                   withAccount:anAccount
           sendProgressHandler:^(unsigned long long bytesSend, unsigned long long bytesTotal) { // e.g., update a progress indicator }
               responseHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, NSData *responseData, NSError *error){
                   // Process the response
               }];
</pre>

#### Getting a signed NSURLRequest

In some circumstances you have to go the *good old way* and use an `NSURLConnection`. Maybe if you want to download a large file. Therefore `NXOAuth2Request` gives you the possibility to get an `NSURLRequest` containing the additional information to authenticate that request.

<pre>
NXOAuth2Request *theRequest = [[NXOAuth2Request alloc] initWithResource:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://...your service URL..."]
									                             method:@"GET"
								                             parameters:nil];
theRequest.account = // ... an account
                               
NSURLRequest *sigendRequest = [theRequest signedURLRequest];

[theRequest release];

// Invoke the request with you preferd method
</pre>

#### Fully Parametrized File Upload

<pre>
// Get fileSize
NSDictionary *fileAttributes = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] attributesOfItemAtPath:uploadFile.localDataFilePath error:nil];
NSNumber *fileSize = [fileAttributes valueForKey:NSFileSize];

// Create a stream wrapper for the upload file
NXOAuth2FileStreamWrapper* w =[NXOAuth2FileStreamWrapper
    wrapperWithStream:[NSInputStream inputStreamWithFileAtPath:uploadFile.localDataFilePath]
        contentLength:[fileSize unsignedLongLongValue]
             fileName:uploadFile.remoteFilename];

if([uploadFile.remoteFilename hasSuffix:@".json"])
    w.contentType = @"application/json";
else
    if([uploadFile.remoteFilename hasSuffix:@".jpg"])
        w.contentType = @"image/jpeg";

// POST Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename=uploadFile.remoteFilename
[NXOAuth2Request performMethod:@"POST" onResource:uploadFile.uploadURL usingParameters:@{@"file": w} withAccount:account
           sendProgressHandler:... responseHandler: ...];
</pre>
